## General info
It is one of the Data Analysing projects which is suppoused to hone my skills in that category.

Main goals of the project were:
* Learn how to remove duplicates.
* Romove unwanted symbols and convert data into numeric format.
* Wrangle columns containing nested data with pandas.
* Create vertical, horizontal and grouped bar charts.
* Create pie and donut charts for categorical data.
* Use colour scale to make scatter plots look better.

As a notebook I used Datalore from Jetbrains.

App and review data was scraped from the Google Play Store by Lavanya Gupta in 2018. [Original data](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps).

It's one of the projects from [Angela's Python Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)
